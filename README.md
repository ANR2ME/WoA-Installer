- A Windows 10 ARM64 Image (.wim)
- A USB-C cable
- A **Driver Package** (you can download it from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/13lrwP7Lc_OLSMxpjhjkaLDrnwM5Cy2Wz))

# Importing the Driver Package
Run WoA Installer and go to the Advanced section. Click on `[Import Driver Pacakge]` and select the .7z file directly. Don't attempt to uncompress it. After the import operation, you will be able to use the application.

# Usage
The application is pretty straigforward to use.
Just a few quick notes:
- If you want to install Windows, just go to the Windows Deployment section and select `Full Install` or `Windows-only Install`
- Don't forget to switch to Mass Storage Mode to perform the operations
